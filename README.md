## MachineLearning_Assignment

### dataset guidelines
The code requires a dataset of the following format in a txt document: 
1st line: Document title
2st line - end of document: Document abstract

### Code guidelines
Please run first the MLP_val_title.ipynb file in order to retrieve the dataset. 
We downloaded the dataset locally on our machines in a file called test_set. 

All the csv files in the repository can be also created via the shared python code. 

The weights are located in the folder 'Weights' and are classified per method and variation.

The final report is the file Machine_Learning_Project.pdf. 

Thank you,
Elena, Eleni, Aris
