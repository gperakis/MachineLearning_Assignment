SDG7,Solid oxide fuel cell hybrid system: A detailed review of an environmentally clean and efficient source of energy,"This paper reports a review of an environmentally clean and efficient source of energy such as solid oxide fuel cell hybrid systems. || Due to climate concerns, most nations are seeking alternative means of generating energy from a clean, efficient and environmental-friendly method. || However, this has proven a big hurdle for both academic and industry researchers over many years. || Currently, practical and technically feasible solution can be obtained via an integration of a microturbine and a fuel cell (hybrid systems). || Combining the two distinct systems in a hybrid arrangement the efficiency of the microturbine increases from 25 to 30% to the 60–65% range. || Hence, this paper outlines an engineering power generation solution towards the acute global population growth, the growing need, environmental concerns, intelligent use of energy with attendant environmental and hybrid system layouts concerning arising problems and tentative proposed solutions. || Furthermore, advantages of a solid oxide fuel cell hybrid systems with respect to the other technologies are identified and discussed rationally. || Special attention is devoted to modelling with software and emulator rigs and system prototypes. || The paper also reviews the limitations and the benefits of these hybrid systems in relationship with energy, environment and sustainable development. || Few potential applications, as long-term potential actions for sustainable development, and the future of such devices are further discussed.","Solid oxide fuel cell hybrid system: A detailed review of an environmentally clean and efficient source of energy || This paper reports a review of an environmentally clean and efficient source of energy such as solid oxide fuel cell hybrid systems. || Due to climate concerns, most nations are seeking alternative means of generating energy from a clean, efficient and environmental-friendly method. || However, this has proven a big hurdle for both academic and industry researchers over many years. || Currently, practical and technically feasible solution can be obtained via an integration of a microturbine and a fuel cell (hybrid systems). || Combining the two distinct systems in a hybrid arrangement the efficiency of the microturbine increases from 25 to 30% to the 60–65% range. || Hence, this paper outlines an engineering power generation solution towards the acute global population growth, the growing need, environmental concerns, intelligent use of energy with attendant environmental and hybrid system layouts concerning arising problems and tentative proposed solutions. || Furthermore, advantages of a solid oxide fuel cell hybrid systems with respect to the other technologies are identified and discussed rationally. || Special attention is devoted to modelling with software and emulator rigs and system prototypes. || The paper also reviews the limitations and the benefits of these hybrid systems in relationship with energy, environment and sustainable development. || Few potential applications, as long-term potential actions for sustainable development, and the future of such devices are further discussed.",SDG7,True

Although soil erosion has serious environmental impacts, the annual erosion-induced C sink offsets up to 10% of the global fossil fuel emissions of carbon dioxide for 2005.","Title:The Significance of the Erosion-induced Terrestrial Carbon Sink || Abstarct:Estimating carbon (C) balance in erosional and depositional landscapes is complicated by the effects of soil redistribution on both net primary productivity (NPP) and decomposition. || Recent studies are contradictory as to whether soil erosion does or does not constitute a C sink. || Here we clarify the conceptual basis for how erosion can constitute a C sink. || Specifically, the criterion for an erosional C sink is that dynamic replacement of eroded C, and reduced decomposition rates in depositional sites, must together more than compensate for erosional losses. || This criterion is in fact met in many erosional settings, and thus erosion and deposition can make a net positive contribution to C sequestration. || We show that, in a cultivated Mississippi watershed and a coastal California watershed, the magnitude of the erosion-induced C sink is likely to be on the order of 1% of NPP and 16% of eroded C. Although soil erosion has serious environmental impacts, the annual erosion-induced C sink offsets up to 10% of the global fossil fuel emissions of carbon dioxide for 2005.",SDG13,True
